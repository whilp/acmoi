# `acmoi`

My acme tools.

## TODO

- Doc/acme-doc (with gogetdoc)
- Test/acme-test
- Build/acme-build
- Manifest/acme-manifest (git ls-files)
- Commit/acme-commit (git commit -v, w/ diff line numbers, perhaps separate windows for message and diff)
- Add/acme-add (git add -f)
- Edit (less janky than E)
- Diff (include plumber-compatible line numbers in git diff output)
- general: shorten files in Errors output relative to Root
